## Sequence Flow

```plantuml
@startuml
autonumber
actor "Guest / Authenticated User" as Actor
boundary "API Gateway" as GW
control "Booking Service" as SVC
database "Booking Database" as DB
control "External Provider / Redis / Related Services" as EXT

Actor -> GW: (1) GET /v1/promotions/:id [BR1]
GW -> GW: (3) Validate authentication, params, query, and body [BR2]
GW -> SVC: (5) Send `promotion.findOne` [BR3]
SVC -> DB: (5) Load records, ownership, and current state [BR3]
SVC -> SVC: (5) Apply business rules and build result [BR3]
SVC -> EXT: (5) Call downstream integration when required [BR3]
EXT --> SVC: Integration result or failure
SVC --> GW: (7)/(8) ServiceResult, DTO, or mapped error [BR4/BR5]
GW --> Actor: API response

## Business Rules

| Activity | BR Code | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| (1) | BR1 | Loading Screen Rules:<br>❖ The system loads the "Get Promotion Details" function and receives the request/event.<br>❖ The system uses trigger [GET /v1/promotions/:id]. |
| (3) | BR2 | Validate Rules:<br>❖ The system checks the items [id].<br>❖ Required fields: [id].<br>❖ If any required entries are empty, the system shows error message MSG 1.<br>❖ Field constraint: [id] is required, type string, path parameter.<br>❖ If any type, format, enum, range, date, UUID, or email constraint is invalid, the system shows error message MSG 4. |
| (5) | BR3 | Retrieval Rules:<br>❖ Promotion code uniqueness is enforced; duplicate code creation/update fails with Promotion code already exists.<br>❖ Percentage discounts are capped by configured max discount; fixed amount discounts cannot exceed the eligible purchase amount.<br>❖ Public list defaults to active promotions unless active=false, null, or undefined is explicitly passed. |
| (7) | BR4 | Message Rules:<br>❖ Successful read operations return the requested DTO/list using the gateway's normal response wrapper; no artificial success text is invented by the spec. |
| (8) | BR5 | Error Handling Rules:<br>❖ Gateway forwards the request to the target service through microservice pattern promotion.findOne and propagates service errors through the common exception layer.<br>❖ Expected failures include Promotion not found, Promotion code already exists, inactive/expired promotion, min-purchase failure, and usage-limit failures.<br>❖ If a constraint, conflict, or unexpected failure occurs, the system shows error message MSG 9. |
